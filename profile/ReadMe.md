We’re the **Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de Colombia (OAN)** — the first astronomical observatory built in the Americas 🌎, founded in **1803**. For more than **two centuries** we've been scanning the skies, unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos, and shaping the future of astronomy in Colombia.

### 🌟 Our Origin Story

It all began thanks to **José Celestino Mutis** and the Botanical Expedition, with the observatory designed by **Domingo de Petrés** and brought to life by the hands of many visionaries. Our early observations started in **1805** under the guidance of **Francisco José de Caldas**, a pioneer of Colombian science.

Through centuries of scientific exploration, historical turning points, and even a few unexpected uses (including as a temporary prison — yes, really 🏰), the OAN has stood strong as a symbol of knowledge and resilience.
